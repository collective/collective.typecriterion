Introduction
============

This product will add to your Plone control panel a new entry: "*Type criterion settings*".

From this panel you can add a set of definition about general content types, which are defined using
a group of existing Plone native types.

For example: you can define a new general type called "Textual contents" that is defined by grouping
Pages, News and Events.

All those definitions can be used in Plone collections by using the new "*General type*" criteria.

Motivation
==========

I found a lot of Plone users that hardly learn the difference between some content types and other.
For example: the difference between a Page and a File is often too tiny in the mind of the site contributor.

With this approach users can only care about some general family on types that a power user can define.
